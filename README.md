# 🚀 Duplexa (Data Redundancy Removal Algorithm)

**Description:**  
Data Redundancy Removal Algorithm is a project aimed at efficiently removing data redundancy from large datasets. The backend is implemented in Python, utilizing the XXHash algorithm to identify and eliminate redundant data. The frontend is developed using ReactJS, providing users with a user-friendly interface to manage and visualize the data.

## Installation 🛠️

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Node.js

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/AnishMane/Duplexa.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Duplexa`
3. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Install Node.js dependencies for the frontend: `npm install`

## Getting Started 🏁

After completing the installation steps, follow these instructions to start using the project:

1. Run the Python backend server: `python app.py`
2. Start the React frontend application: `npm start`
3. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage 💻

To use the Data Redundancy Removal Algorithm:

1. Upload your dataset to the application.
2. The algorithm will analyze the dataset and remove redundant data using the XXHash algorithm.
3. View the optimized dataset and download the processed data if needed.

## Troubleshooting 🛠️

### Issue: Backend server fails to start
- **Solution:** Ensure that Python 3.x is installed and all dependencies are installed correctly. Check for any error messages in the console for further diagnosis.

### Issue: Frontend application crashes unexpectedly
- **Solution:** Make sure Node.js is installed and all frontend dependencies are installed using `npm install`. Check the console for any error messages to identify the issue.
